            RNA mutational analysis at the secondary-structure
            level can be useful to a wide-range of biological applications.
            It can be used to predict an optimal site
            for performing a nucleotide mutation at the single
            molecular level, as well as to analyze basic phenomena
            at the systems level. For the former, as more
            sequence modification experiments are performed
            that include site-directed mutagenesis to find and
            explore functional motifs in RNAs, a pre-processing
            step that helps guide in planning the experiment
            becomes vital. For the latter, mutations are generally
            accepted as a central mechanism by which evolution
            occurs, and mutational analysis relating to
            structure should gain a better understanding of
            system functionality and evolution. In the past
            several years, the program RNAmute that is structure
            based and relies on RNA secondary-structure
            prediction has been developed for assisting in RNA
            mutational analysis. It has been extended from
            single-point mutations to treat multiple-point mutations
            efficiently by initially calculating all suboptimal
            solutions, after which only the mutations that stabilize
            the suboptimal solutions and destabilize the
            optimal one are considered as candidates for being deleterious.

                RNAMute is an interactive Web tool that 
                calculates the secondary structure of all single point mutations, given 
                an RNA sequence, and organizes them into categories according to their 
                distances from the wildtype predicted structure. The secondary structure 
                predictions are performed using the Vienna RNA package. Several alternatives 
                are used for the categorization of single point mutations: Vienna's RNADistance 
                based on dot-bracket representation, tree edit distance, and second eigenvalue of 
                the Laplacian matrix based on Shapiro's coarse grain tree-graph representation.
                Selecting a category in each one of the tables lists all single point mutations 
                belonging to that category. Selecting a mutation displays a graphical picture of
                the single point mutation and the wildtype, and includes basic information such
                as associated energies, representations, distances. RNAMute is a user friendly 
                tool that can be used to predict single point mutations leading to conformational
                rearrangements in the secondary structure of RNAs.
